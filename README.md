- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended: RTX 3090+)
- Python 3.12+ (for client development)

### Run with Docker

1. **Start with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker run \
     -p 8420:8420 \
     -v ./models:/app/models \

### Core Endpoints

#### Voice Management
- `GET /voices` - List all available voices
- `POST /voices` - Upload a new voice (MP3 + optional transcript)
- `DELETE /voices/{voice_id}` - Remove a voice
- `GET /voices/{voice_id}` - Get voice details

#### Text-to-Speech
- `POST /tts` - Generate speech from text (instant response)
- `POST /tts/stream` - Stream audio generation

### Example Usage

```bash
# Upload a new voice with transcript
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8420/voices" \
  -F "audio=@sample.mp3" \
  -F "transcript=$(cat transcript.txt)" \
  -F "name=my_voice"

# Generate TTS
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8420/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world!", "voice_id": "my_voice"}' \
  --output output.mp3
```

## üêç Python Client

The Python client is available on PyPI as `plomtts-client`.

### Installation
```bash
pip install plomtts-client
```

### Usage
```python
from plomtts import TTSClient

client = TTSClient("http://localhost:8420")

# Upload a voice with transcript
with open("sample.mp3", "rb") as audio, open("transcript.txt", "r") as transcript:
    voice = client.create_voice(
        name="my_voice",
        audio=audio,
        transcript=transcript.read()
    )

# Upload a voice without transcript (auto-generated)
with open("sample.mp3", "rb") as audio:
    voice = client.create_voice(
        name="my_voice",
        audio=audio
    )

# Generate speech
audio_bytes = client.generate_speech(
    text="Hello, this is AI-generated speech!",
    voice_id=voice.id
)

# Save audio
with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_bytes)
```
